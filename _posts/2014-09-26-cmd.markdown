There exist many unix/linux that are essentially operators in DBMS.
In a simple DBMS, what do we really need?
Some `join`, some `projection`, `selection`, and `sorting`.
By combining them together, we can build a very simple DBMS for text data.
Some links to use, [1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1394998/parsing-sql-with-python), 
[2](http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/),
[3](http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/share/view/5853862).

Right now I want to answer the simplest question:
> select * from some_file;

So I have to make up some rules:
* column can be a number or alias:number, where alias is a,...,z by default or defined using `AS`.
